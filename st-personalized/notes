	goes with st-git-20141122-argbbg.diff, if anyone cares
Transparency is the only patch applied.
	I've opted to rely on launching urls by having dwm process xsel
	Scrollback is now handled by dvtm as per the suckless intended way
I added my own patch that screws up classes. The -c switch only changed instance, not class, so I couldn't get st to work with dwm runorraise. The result of this patch: both instance and class are set with the -c switch, if -c is not used, the instance and classname are set to empty strings
