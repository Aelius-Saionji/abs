Removed any direct reference to a browser, everything points to browser.sh, except run or raise
Added 'modkey u' to send the selected text to browser.sh
Tried dwm fifo patch, compiles but doesn't run
Removed media tag and associated programs- it's just never intuitive
Manually changed all layout patches to #include a new c file instead of patching dwm.c.
	Updates to dwm should no longer break the patches
