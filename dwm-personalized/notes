dwm-personalized-1:6.0.43.g14343e6-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz
	Built 2015 April 30th

	Had to remove the following patches (no attempt was made to merge them, really):
		dwm-6.1-float_border_color2.diff
		dwm-master_2013-08-27_cdec978-tab-v2a.diff
	config.h change: var "font" to "*fonts", which is a different type. Added var dmenufont.
	Made the statusbar font smaller
	Changed window border from 1px to 0, because I figured out transparency for inactive windows.
	Set background with feh, not qiv (because qiv doesn't work for transparency)
	Added dwb to the list of browsers
	Removed any direct reference to a browser, everything points to browser.sh, except run or raise
	Added 'modkey u' to send the selected text to browser.sh
	Added a * tag, so cmd can be exclusive to terminals
	modified termcmd so it launches with a class, due to removing the class by default in my st
	xprop returns wm(class)=instance,class. run or raise needs instance to exist, but matches against class. run or raise also wants st -t title to match :?
		Not possible to correctly alter class of an existing window. Should probably learn c and fix run or raise to match against instance
	removed swapfocus patch
	removed nametag patch
	removed other patches
		consider removing the different layouts I never use
	added hide empty tags patch, is weird, probably remove later
	tried dwm fifo patch, compiles but doesn't run
	added class.patch to give the statusbar a classname, can now exclude from compton more accurately
	removed media tag and associated programs- it's just never intuitive
	Learned about makepkg --allsource to preserve git version.
		--------> This does not prevent a git pull when building, use makepkg -e to build from existing source.
