Changed window border from 1px to 0, because I figured out transparency for inactive windows.
Removed any direct reference to a browser, everything points to browser.sh, except run or raise
Added 'modkey u' to send the selected text to browser.sh
modified termcmd so it launches with a class, due to removing the class by default in my st
xprop returns wm(class)=instance,class. run or raise needs instance to exist, but matches against class. run or raise also wants st -t title to match :?
	Not possible to correctly alter class of an existing window. Should probably learn c and fix run or raise to match against instance
tried dwm fifo patch, compiles but doesn't run
added class.patch to give the statusbar a classname, can now exclude from compton more accurately
removed media tag and associated programs- it's just never intuitive
